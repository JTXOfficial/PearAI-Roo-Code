in tasks.json, the labels on the tasks are just for human readability.
labels dont uniquely identify the npm type tasks.

for npm type tasks, if you have two tasks with different labels but same script, 
the one defined last will be registered as the task or override the previous one.

A simple workaround is to duplicate the script in package.json with a different name but the same command and use that. 
This allows you to have multiple tasks referencing different script names that execute the same command.

another workaround is add 
"path": "."
'.', or './.' or '././.' etc.
to the task definition. though this might stop working in the future if vscode changes how it handles tasks.
